# CNN
Implementation of different CNN architectures.

1. VGG was first introduced in the paper [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) I have implemented [vgg-19](https://github.com/Wajahat-AliKhan/CNN/blob/main/vgg_19.py) on CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. GoogLeNet was first introduced in the paper [Going deeper with convolutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4842.pdf) I have implmented [GoogLeNet](https://github.com/Wajahat-AliKhan/CNN/blob/main/GoogLeNet.py) on CIFAR-10 dataset.
